* Functionality
** Parameterized queries should be able to take lists of params.
** Support ODBC options where applicable.
** Test functions die (or don't) correctly when not connected to DB.
** Connection pooling with multiple databases.
I'm guessing that it doesn't work right now. Looks like
mysqlerl_connection_sup:connect starts a simple-one-for-one port, and
commands use :random_child to do dispatch. That's bad.
* Documentation
* Tests
** Code Coverage
Check out http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/common_test/cover_chapter.html
** Transactions
** Insert/Update/Replace/Delete Behavior
Make sure affected_rows are returned properly and no cursor exists.
** Bogus behavor
Cursor stuff, only owners should be able to disconnect, more error
response tuples returned to Erlang runtime.

Check out a bunch of the logmsg("ERROR: ...") in the various C files,
and pore over ODBC man page again.
